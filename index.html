          <p>
            American Quarter Horse, one of the oldest recognized breeds of
            horses in the United States. The breed originated about the 1660s as
            a cross between native horses of Spanish origin used by the earliest
            colonists and English horses imported to Virginia from about 1610.
            By the late 17th century, these horses were being raced successfully
            over quarter-mile courses in Rhode Island and Virginia, and hence
            received the name Quarter Horses. The Quarter Horse was bred for
            performance and had considerable Thoroughbred blood as well as
            traits of other lines. Important sires include Janus, an English
            Thoroughbred imported to Virginia in 1756; Steel Dust (b. 1843); and
            Peter McCue (b. 1895), called the most influential sire in improving
            the breed.
